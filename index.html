            The Media has become a major part of our lives and moreover so firms have continued to benefit from it, how?

            shall be allotted to the teams.</p>
        <h4><a id="Round_2_25"></a>Round 2</h4>

        <h1 style="font-size: 2.8em;color: #000000">Wall Street</h1>

        <p>This year at the Aitchison Business Concept, we are introducing the Wall Street challenge that aims to test
            the participants and the core of their marketing ex-pertise. This challenge will incorporate three segments
            of business; the stock market auctioning and individual marketing. while all the other competitions at ACSEC
            will put your teams business ideas and critical thinking to test, the Wall Street challenge aims to have the
            participants compete on an individual level. There will only be one winner of this competition and will be
            declared the Wolf of Wall Street.</p>

        <p><strong>Only two members of each team may participate in this event.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>The currency used in this event will be ACR.</strong></p>

        <h3><a id="Event_Format_7"></a>Event Format</h3>
        <h5><a id="Round_1_9"></a>Round 1</h5>

        <p>In the first round teams will have to set up stalls to sell their product/service. Each team
            will be provided the following:</p>
        <ul style="width: 30%;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto">
            <li>Custom Currency - *ACR 500 (ACR 10 * 50)</li>
            <li>1 Table</li>
            <li>1 Board 8ft by 4 ft.</li>
            <li>Miscellaneous materials to make stalls :Chart paper markers, ribbons etc.</li>
            <li>ACR= Aitchison College Rupee</li>
            <li>2 Chairs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
A maximum of four members can take part in this event from each team. The teams will be given 3 hours to decorate their stalls and make them look as attractive as possible with the materials provided by the main stall.
The concept of “first come first serve” will be used as there will only be a limited number of products. The team will be given a specific amount of money in ACR which they will have to use carefully as they can only buy a specific number of the above mentioned products and not all. However teams can sell their products to other teams at a higher price and use that money to buy a product that will benefit them. This will not only give them a chance to redecorate their stall if they made a wrong purchase but their thinking and creativity skills will also be put into test and all these transactions will be noted down by a host team member.</p>

        <p><strong>There will be no elimination; all teams will go forward to Round 2</strong></p>
        <h4><a id="Round_2_25"></a>Round 2</h4>

        <p>The judges will examine the stalls of all the teams. 20% of the score would be on the basis of the stalls’ designs, whereas, 80% of the score would be on the basis of Marketing and Presenting. Basically, teams have to market their products in a strategic manner in order to make them appeal to the judges. It is advisable that each team spend about 3- 4 minutes to demonstrate their product to the judges. The top 7 teams from this Round will advance to the Final Round.</p>

<h4>Round 3</h4>

<p>
    In this round, the teams will be allotted a concept/idea which they will have to incorporate in their products. Each team will then have come up with a Business Plan Presentation. The Plan should be inclusive in the sense that it should cover points on how the product shall be introduced in the market and how it should be targeted to consumers. All the teams would be required to be as comprehensive as possible within the allotted time frame of 5-8 minutes. Just like Kickstarter, the participants will be expected to raise a certain amount of money to fund their products by pitching their plans to the judges/investors. Since every judge will only have a limited amount of funds, they will have the choice to apportion their funds accordingly. The fun part is that there will be no judging criteria and simply the product that gets funded completely or bags the maximum amount of funding would be declared the Winner. Awards: The winner of this event will be awarded a shield and declared the Wolf of Wall Street.
