            <h1>Welcome to ACSEC</h1>

                <p>The Aitchison College Science and Entrepreneurial Society has a longstanding legacy of being one
    of the biggest Science and Entrepreneurial societies in Pakistan. In the past couple of years, the
    society has organised two independent events: The Aitchison College Science and Engineering
    Concept and the Aitchison College Business Concept. This year, however, we have decided to merge
    the two events together to form a collective science and entrepreneurial Olympiad. Our reason for
    doing so is simple: one cannot be without the other. Like yin and yang combine together to formulate
    the whole package, an idea conceived by a scientist has no merit unless it is properly marketed to
    the consumer and provides them with a measurable benefit. </p>

        <p>With the main aim of firms being profit maximization, the social impact of their actions is given little or no importance whatsoever. It is our duty as the upcoming generation of entrepreneurs to ensure that along with conventional business objectives, we also give due importance to the impact of our actions as firms on society and the environment. So if you want to highlight a plight faced in society today and to help cure it, then the Corporate Social Responsibility event provides the perfect platform to do so.

        <h1 style="font-size: 2.8em;color: #000000">MathMaze</h1>

        <p>In this edition of the event we have the aim of breaking away from the stereotype that math holds in many people’s minds as a banal, boring subject and make it as immersing and enjoyable as possible while at the same time intellectually challenging them to the fullest. Breaking math will contain a variety of questions, linked to mathematical topics being learnt in school, while also testing the logical and analytical skills of the participants in relation to mathematics. Each round will present a unique challenge and the ability of contestants to adapt to foreign concepts will be necessary to succeed in the event. 

</p>

        <h3><a id="Event_Format_4"></a>Event Format</h3>
        <h5><a id="Round_1_6"></a>Round 1</h5>

        <p>The first round will be a written quiz testing the competitors’ grasp of general mathematical terms, formulas and problems. It will mostly include questions pertaining to the O-level syllabus. There will also be a puzzle solving section containing brain teasers, logic problems, puzzles (e.g. Bridge, Sudoku, KenKen etc.) and Alphametics puzzles, otherwise known as cryptarithms. These are the puzzles where the digits have been replaced with alphabets, each alphabet representing a different digit.</p>
        <p>There will be no limit to the number of participants of one team that can take part in this round. The total points will be calculated, with the top ten teams qualifying for the next round.</p>

        

        <h5>Round 2</h5>

        <p>The third round is set to be the toughest round of the event. In this round the teams will have 3 hours to solve just 5-6 questions. However, the questions asked will be extremely difficult, requiring not only sound knowledge of advanced mathematical formulas and techniques but also good logical skills. The questions will mostly be lengthy proofs relating to the topics of Geometry, Sequences and Series, Mathematical Induction and high level Integration and Algebra.

        </p>

        <p>There will be no limit to the number of competitors of one team that can participate in this round. Only five teams will qualify for the final round.
</p>
        <h5>Round 3</h5>

        <p>It is one thing to be able to solve mathematical problems but to be able to do so quickly and under pressure is an art of its own. The last round of the event will, therefore, be a rapidfire. Like the first round, will test the basic mathematical knowledge of the teams. <br/><br/>    
However, this time they will also be put under time constraints. Questions will be projected on a screen and the teams will need to solve as many as they can in a mere 120 seconds.  Only 2 team members will be eligible for this round

        </p>

        <p>Resources here on our mother planet, Earth, are depleting rapidly, and there is still a mighty chance that Earth’s resources will be completely exhausted. Cosmic Corona aims to provide a platform to students looking to express their views on space exploration, and how and what would a space settlement look like, if it was to come into being. Each team will comprise of 4 students.


        </p>

        <h5><a id="Round_2_25"></a>Round 1</h5>

        <p>In this round, teams will be required to prepare a written document beforehand and submit on Day 1. This document will entail the proposal for ways of enhancing sustainability of resources, and therefore, preventing space colonization. Each team will be judged on their ability to reason logically, and their creativity.

</p>
        <h5><a id="Round_2_25"></a>Round 2</h5>

        <p>In the second round, delegates will first be interviewed with questions being based on general space knowledge and facts specific to the document they submitted in Round 1. Based on performance in the interview, teams will be grouped into larger companies, and these companies will then be issued a generic RFP (Request For Proposal). The companies will then have to make a presentation on a proposed, fully functional space settlement design. 
</p>
        <h5>Round 3</h5>

        <p>This presentation will be presented by its makers to a panel of esteemed judges. (Presentation time: 15 minutes)</p>

        <p>We realize the philosophical free soul that whimpers within your otherwise scientifically driven body. To your mathematical formula-deciphering yin, we understand that there is a rather ingrained expressive, humorous, quirky and uniquely articulate yang. In the dawn of this realization, and catering to the needs of this more than make-believe yang of yours, ACSEC gets lit! <br/>
ACSEC Literary Showdown is your chance to experience a twist in the usual science rut and bring out the writer/thinker/comic/ruminator within you while keeping your scientific bearings intact. Perhaps now, better than never, and more than ever: you write like a commoner and prove that there’s a human coexisting with that scientific intellect!<br/>

        <h5><a id="Round_1_9"></a>Round 1: Warm Up</h5>

        <p>
            Don’t get us wrong, but can you face cohorts of people asking you to write love-letters with scientific puns? Imagine this: the common crowd sees you, sitting gallantly at a laptop boasting ever so gallantly a placard that says: “I can write things you’re not even aware of”. Of course, you don’t expect the crowds to show mercy to such an outrageous claim, do you? Better prep yourself then. Certainly, a winner would have more public at their stand.<br/><br/>
And the public? Oh, they love the unordinary.



        </p>

        <p>
                <h5><a id="Round_1_9"></a>Round 2: Caption/Meme this</h5>
        
<p>While everyone’s busy doing serious stuff, not to say that you will not be doing serious work but let’s stick to the ground realities now, you get to team up with photographers of our media portal and caption/meme pictures of those who’re actually working. Again, this is work too. Participants get only so many pictures to work with and the general public puts their fate to its destination. (Protip: Geeks love memes with boring scientific jokes)



</p>

 <h5><a id="Round_1_9"></a>Round 3: Open Lettered</h5>
        
<p>This is it. This is where you get those closed doors you’ve been acquainted to. <br/>
There’s no research to pursue behind these doors, though. Just plain-old letter writing.<br/>
Write a letter, a simple yet elegant and eloquent letter.<br/>
To: The President of Islamic Republic of Pakistan<br/>
What should you say? That’s something you decide.<br/>
From our side, all we require from you is an elaborate indication that you are trying your level best to convince the President of the promise that lies within the scientific arena. <br/>
Again, no limits here. You must know when to stop, not us. Coherence is the key.<br/>
Win our hearts please, not the brain. Not this time.<br/>

            <li>Exit Strategy</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The presentation should be of 8 – 10 minutes. After the presentation, the investors may consider your offer reasonable and give you the money, they will make you a new offer, or if they do not like your business idea, they will reject your offer. The investors may offer a lower amount of money, ask for royalty, or ask for a higher percentage of shares. The teams may negotiate these offers with the panel and then finally, accept or reject a deal. Teams will be judged on their presentation, how practical their business is the feasibility of their financials and the kind of deal they accept.
